                            than Subhas Chandra Bose.He was born on 23rd January 1897. He was a radical nationalist 
                            and his ultimate patriotism carved a hero out of him.</b></p>

                            <p><b>Bose disagreed with the ideals of non-violence promoted by Gandhi, instead of
                                 believing that only armed revolt could oust the British from India. 
                                The founder of the Forward Bloc, he escaped the eyes of the British
                                 to ultimately reach Germany during the second world war. </b></p>
